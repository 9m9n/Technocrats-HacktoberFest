/*   
     Articulation Points (or Cut Vertices) in a Graph

     A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) if removing it (and edges through it) disconnects
     the graph. Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split the network 
     into 2 or more components. 
     For a disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex removing which increases number of connected components.
*/

/*
    A O(V+E) algorithm to find all Articulation Points (APs) 
    The idea is to use DFS (Depth First Search). In DFS, we follow vertices in tree form called DFS tree. In DFS tree, a vertex u is parent of another vertex v, if v is discovered by u (obviously v is an adjacent of u in graph). In DFS tree, a vertex u is articulation point if one of the following two conditions is true. 
    1) u is root of DFS tree and it has at least two children. 
    2) u is not root of DFS tree and it has a child v such that no vertex in subtree rooted with v has a back edge to one of the ancestors (in DFS tree) of u.
