# OOPS in Python

In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. 

## Topics:

## 1. Inheritance
Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or base class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class

## 2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit

## 3. Abstraction
Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. User is familiar with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does."

## 4. Polymorphisms
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types.
