## FLUTTER/DART

Team Technocrats welcome you to contribute your snippets and working codes with us.
Read the Contributing Guidelines and get yourself added to the list of contributors.

Quick Recap for contributing.

- Make a new folder with name `YourName_username` (For example: SufiyanAnsari_suffisme)
- If already existing then simply head over it, don't create it everytime
- Then add your file there with the proper name showing the basic functionality of that code you are sharing, For example: `API_fetch.dart` clearly shows a dart file for fetching data via API
